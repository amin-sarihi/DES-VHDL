# DES-VHDL
VHDL implementation of Data Encryption Standard based on http://page.math.tu-berlin.de/~kant/teaching/hess/krypto-ws2006/des.htm
It both encrypts and decrypts data. The dcryption is actually the inverse of encryption which means that you have to stat from subkey 16 and go all the way down to 1.
